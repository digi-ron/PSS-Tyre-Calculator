# PSS-Tyre-Calculator
Simple functionality for commonly used tyre sizes

## HOW-TO
- run the _RUN.ps1 file with PowerShell and go through the prompts as required

## NOTES
- I made this to calculate legal sizes of tyres in Australia, without having to search each size individually. No updates planned, but the json file in this repo could easily be used for other projects if needed
- There's no reason this was made in PowerShell other than I wanted to, and the only thing I did for code-cleanliness was make a function file to import into the main file (does that make this a MVC project? I'm not sure I want to answer that)
